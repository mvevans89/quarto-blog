#### Hello! I'm a post-doctoral researcher in disease ecology and public health. 

<br>
I work with colleagues at [MIVEGEC](https://mivegec.fr/fr) at the Institut de Recherche pour le DÃ©veloppement in Montpellier, France and [PIVOT](https://www.pivotworks.org/), in southeastern Madagascar. We're working on questions of disease ecology in the context of health system strengthening. I'm interested in how ecologists and public health stakeholders work together to create tools and systems that are useful to folks on the ground. I also like playing around with data, particularly maps.

For more information, use the tabs above to navigate to my [Rstats blog](blog.qmd), [academic publications](pubs.qmd), or [check out my CV](assets/MVEvansCV.pdf).
