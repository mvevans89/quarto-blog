Every now and then I have trouble getting something to work that I could do very quickly in base `R`, but that seems to be happening less and less as more SO questions use the `tidyverse` and documentation gets better and better.\n\nAnyways, I am a little late to the party but I recently discovered that you can pipe directly from your `dplyr` calls into `ggplot2`, manipulating and plotting your data all at once. I hate filling my environment with similar objects. These normally end up being something like dataframe1, dataframe2, dataframe3, etc. because I have no creativity when it comes to names and in the end becoming an unusable mess. Using this piping lets you try-out transformations, scaling, or centering and visualize them without having to add extra columns to your dataframe or create new objects.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nGo about your normal data wrangling with dplyr, maybe creating a new variable with mutate. Then, simply pipe into your ggplot call, using the `.` to represent the data you are feeding into it:\n\n```{r}\ndiamonds %>%\n  #calculate the volume\n  mutate(volume = x * y * z) %>%\n  #drop crazy outlier\n  filter(volume < 2000) %>%\n  ggplot(data = ., aes (x = cut, y = volume)) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cut))\n```\n\nThe other key thing to note is that once you switch over to `ggplot` you need to use `+` (plus sign) to pipe and not the `magrittr` style pipe (`%>%`). If not, you'll get an error like this:\n\n```{r, eval = F}\ndiamonds %>%\n  #calculate the volume\n  mutate(volume = x * y * z) %>%\n  #drop crazy outlier\n  filter(volume < 2000) %>%\n  ggplot(data = ., aes (x = cut, y = volume))  %>% #this is the wrong pipe!\n    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cut))\n\n#> Did you accidentally pass `aes()` to the `data` argument?\n```\n\nUnfortunately that error isn't very informative, but it has to with the incorrect pipe usage within the `ggplot` portion of the call.\n\nAnd that's it. Start using this piping and watch your workspace declutter itself!\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.253","theme":{"dark":"cyborg","light":"flatly"},"title-block-banner":true,"title":"dplyr and ggplot pipe dreams","description":"Using pipes with dplyr and ggplot2","author":"Michelle Evans","date":"6/15/2018","draft":false,"image":"pipe-image.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
