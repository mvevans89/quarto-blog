{"title":"dplyr and ggplot pipe dreams","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"dplyr and ggplot pipe dreams","description":"Using pipes with dplyr and ggplot2","author":"Michelle Evans","date":"6/15/2018","draft":false,"image":"pipe-image-120.png"},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nI've been getting more and more immersed into using `tidyverse` packages as time goes on. Every now and then I have trouble getting something to work that I could do very quickly in base `R`, but that seems to be happening less and less as more SO questions use the `tidyverse` and documentation gets better and better.\n\nAnyways, I am a little late to the party but I recently discovered that you can pipe directly from your `dplyr` calls into `ggplot2`, manipulating and plotting your data all at once. I hate filling my environment with similar objects. These normally end up being something like dataframe1, dataframe2, dataframe3, etc. because I have no creativity when it comes to names and in the end becoming an unusable mess. Using this piping lets you try-out transformations, scaling, or centering and visualize them without having to add extra columns to your dataframe or create new objects.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nGo about your normal data wrangling with dplyr, maybe creating a new variable with mutate. Then, simply pipe into your ggplot call, using the `.` to represent the data you are feeding into it:\n\n```{r}\ndiamonds %>%\n  #calculate the volume\n  mutate(volume = x * y * z) %>%\n  #drop crazy outlier\n  filter(volume < 2000) %>%\n  ggplot(data = ., aes (x = cut, y = volume)) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cut))\n```\n\nThe other key thing to note is that once you switch over to `ggplot` you need to use `+` (plus sign) to pipe and not the `magrittr` style pipe (`%>%`). If not, you'll get an error like this:\n\n```{r, eval = F}\ndiamonds %>%\n  #calculate the volume\n  mutate(volume = x * y * z) %>%\n  #drop crazy outlier\n  filter(volume < 2000) %>%\n  ggplot(data = ., aes (x = cut, y = volume))  %>% #this is the wrong pipe!\n    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cut))\n\n#> Error: `data` must be a data frame, or other object coercible by `fortify()`, not an S3 object with class uneval\n#> Did you accidentally pass `aes()` to the `data` argument?\n```\n\nUnfortunately that error isn't very informative, but it has to with the incorrect pipe usage within the `ggplot` portion of the call.\n\nAnd that's it. Start using this piping and watch your workspace declutter itself!\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nI've been getting more and more immersed into using `tidyverse` packages as time goes on.
